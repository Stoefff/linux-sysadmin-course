### /etc/networks
* Giving the network a name

### /etc/services
* Downloaded by YANA
* Port services

### Wireless

* If the wnetwork is set with a hidden SSID but we can see every other thing
and with kissnet cmd we can even get the name for about 20 mins

### Encrypting commands
* wpa_passphrase
* wpa_supplicant

### VLAN-s
* vconfig
* vlan listing is complex: chech /proc/net/vlan/config
